# MediaManager
MediaManager is an all-in-one media portal that can be used to manage movies, TV series and music. MediaManager will automatically pull data about your media from the internet, and display it in a neat convenient matter. It is designed to be simple, but to also (eventually) be more powerful than other programs aiming to achieve the same thing.
There is currently only one developer.
